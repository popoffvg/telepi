# TelePi

TelePi is a Telegram bridge for the [Pi coding agent](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) SDK. It lets you continue Pi sessions from Telegram — hand off from the CLI, keep working on your phone, and hand back when you're at your desk. Send a voice message and TelePi will transcribe it and feed it straight into Pi.

## Features

- **Bi-directional hand-off**: Move sessions CLI → Telegram (`/handoff`) and back (`/handback`)
- **Per-chat/topic sessions**: Every Telegram chat or forum topic gets its own Pi session, picker state, and retry history
- **Voice messages**: Send a voice note or audio file and TelePi transcribes it into a Pi prompt
- **Local or cloud transcription**: [Parakeet CoreML](https://github.com/badlogic/parakeet-coreml) on Apple Silicon, [Sherpa-ONNX Parakeet](https://k2-fsa.github.io/sherpa/onnx/) for Intel Macs (and as a CPU fallback), or OpenAI Whisper in the cloud
- **Session tree navigation**: Browse, branch, and label your Pi session history with `/tree`, `/branch`, `/label`
- **Cross-workspace sessions**: Browse and switch between sessions from any project
- **Model switching**: Change AI models on the fly via `/model`
- **Workspace-aware `/new`**: Create sessions in any known project workspace
- **Helpful recovery commands**: `/help` for quick usage guidance and `/retry` to resend the last prompt in the current chat/topic
- **Native Telegram UX**: Topic-safe inline keyboards, typing indicators, HTML-formatted responses, friendly user-facing errors, auto-retry on rate limits
- **Security**: Telegram user allowlist, workspace-scoped tools, Docker support

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- A Telegram bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
- Pi installed locally with working credentials in `~/.pi/agent/auth.json`

## Production Install from GitHub Releases

Use GitHub Releases when you want a built artifact for a stable version without cloning the repo.

1. Download `telepi-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz` and `telepi-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz.sha256` from the matching [GitHub Releases page](../../releases)
2. Verify the checksum:
   ```bash
   shasum -c telepi-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz.sha256
   ```
3. Extract the release artifact:
   ```bash
   tar -xzf telepi-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz
   cd telepi-vX.Y.Z
   ```
4. Install production dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm ci --omit=dev --omit=optional
   ```
   If you want local/offline voice transcription later, install the optional backend you want manually (for example `npm install parakeet-coreml` or `npm install sherpa-onnx-node`).
5. Copy the example environment file and fill it in:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   - `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` — your bot token from BotFather
   - `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USER_IDS` — your Telegram numeric user ID (comma-separated for multiple)
   - `PI_SESSION_PATH` *(optional)* — open a specific Pi session JSONL file for hand-off
   - `PI_MODEL` *(optional)* — force a specific model, e.g. `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5`
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` *(optional)* — enable cloud-based voice transcription via OpenAI Whisper
   - `SHERPA_ONNX_MODEL_DIR` *(optional)* — path to an extracted Sherpa-ONNX Parakeet model directory (primarily for Intel Macs)
   - `SHERPA_ONNX_NUM_THREADS` *(optional)* — CPU threads for Sherpa-ONNX (default: `2`)
   - `TOOL_VERBOSITY` *(optional)* — `all` | `summary` | `errors-only` | `none` (default: `summary`)
6. Start TelePi manually:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The release artifact includes the built `dist/` output plus `.env.example`, a runtime `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `extensions/telepi-handoff.ts`, and `launchd/com.telepi.plist`.

### launchd with a release artifact (macOS)

1. Keep the extracted release directory in a stable location, e.g. `/opt/telepi/telepi-vX.Y.Z`
2. Copy `launchd/com.telepi.plist` to `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.telepi.plist`
3. Replace the placeholder paths with:
   - the extracted release directory as `WorkingDirectory`
   - your Node binary path as the first `ProgramArguments` entry
   - `<release-dir>/dist/index.js` as the second `ProgramArguments` entry
   - real stdout/stderr log paths
4. Ensure your `.env` file lives in the same extracted release directory
5. Load and start the agent:
   ```bash
   launchctl bootstrap gui/$UID ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.telepi.plist
   ```

If you later change the plist or `.env`, restart it with:

```bash
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$UID/com.telepi
```

## Development from Source

Use a source checkout when you want to hack on TelePi or run the latest unreleased code.

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Copy the example environment file and fill it in:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
3. Start the bot in development mode:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. If you want to run the built production entrypoint from source, build first:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   node dist/index.js
   ```

## Telegram Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/start` | Welcome message, session info, and voice backend status |
| `/help` | Quick command reference and usage tips |
| `/new` | Create a fresh session (shows workspace picker if multiple known) |
| `/retry` | Re-send the last prompt in the current chat/topic |
| `/handback` | Hand session back to Pi CLI (copies resume command to clipboard) |
| `/abort` | Cancel the current Pi operation |
| `/session` | Show current session details (ID, file, workspace, model) |
| `/sessions` | List all sessions across all workspaces with tap-to-switch buttons |
| `/sessions <path\|id>` | Switch directly to a specific session file or session ID/prefix |
| `/model` | Pick a different AI model from an inline keyboard |
| `/tree` | View the session entry tree; navigate with inline buttons |
| `/branch <id>` | Navigate to a specific entry ID (with confirmation) |
| `/label [args]` | Add or clear labels on entries for easy reference |

Sessions, inline keyboards, and `/retry` state are isolated per Telegram chat/topic, so forum topics can be used independently without colliding with each other.

## Voice Messages

Send any Telegram **voice message** or **audio file** and TelePi will transcribe it and feed the transcript straight into Pi as a text prompt.

```
[you send a voice message]
🎤 "How does the session hand-off work?" (via parakeet)

[Pi responds normally]
```

TelePi supports three transcription backends and picks the best one automatically:

| Backend | How to enable | Cost | Privacy |
|---------|---------------|------|---------|
| **Parakeet CoreML** (local) | `npm install parakeet-coreml` + `brew install ffmpeg` | Free | On-device |
| **Sherpa-ONNX Parakeet** (local, Intel Mac path) | `npm install sherpa-onnx-node` + download model + set `SHERPA_ONNX_MODEL_DIR` | Free | On-device |
| **OpenAI Whisper** (cloud) | `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...` in `.env` | ~$0.006/min | Cloud |

TelePi tries backends in this order:

1. **Parakeet CoreML** — best local path on Apple Silicon
2. **Sherpa-ONNX Parakeet** — the local/offline path for Intel Macs, where `parakeet-coreml` does not run (and a CPU fallback on Apple Silicon)
3. **OpenAI Whisper** — cloud fallback

The `/start` command shows which backends are currently active.

### Installing Parakeet CoreML (local transcription on Apple Silicon)

Parakeet CoreML is an optional dependency (~1.5 GB download, macOS only with Apple Silicon):

```bash
npm install parakeet-coreml
brew install ffmpeg   # required for audio decoding
```

On first use the CoreML model is downloaded automatically. Subsequent calls use the cached model.

### Installing Sherpa-ONNX Parakeet (local transcription for Intel Macs)

This is the recommended local transcription path on Intel Macs, since `parakeet-coreml` is Apple-Silicon-only. It can also be used on Apple Silicon, but TelePi will still prefer Parakeet CoreML there when available.

Install the optional Node binding:

```bash
npm install sherpa-onnx-node
brew install ffmpeg   # required for audio decoding
```

Download and extract the Parakeet model layout TelePi expects (`encoder.int8.onnx`, `decoder.int8.onnx`, `joiner.int8.onnx`, `tokens.txt`). The v3 multilingual model below is the intended Intel Mac setup:

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx/releases/download/asr-models/sherpa-onnx-nemo-parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-int8.tar.bz2
tar xvf sherpa-onnx-nemo-parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-int8.tar.bz2
```

Point TelePi at the extracted directory:

```bash
export SHERPA_ONNX_MODEL_DIR="$(pwd)/sherpa-onnx-nemo-parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-int8"
```

If `SHERPA_ONNX_MODEL_DIR` is set, TelePi treats missing model files or a missing `sherpa-onnx-node` package as configuration errors and will not silently fall through to OpenAI.

If the native module cannot find its shared libraries on macOS, start TelePi with:

```bash
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="$(pwd)/node_modules/sherpa-onnx-darwin-$(uname -m | sed 's/x86_64/x64/;s/arm64/arm64/'):${DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH}"
```

For the exact family of Sherpa Parakeet models TelePi currently supports, plus platform notes, see:

- https://k2-fsa.github.io/sherpa/onnx/pretrained_models/offline-transducer/nemo-transducer-models.html

### Using OpenAI Whisper (cloud transcription)

Add your key to `.env`:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

No additional packages are required. Supports the same audio formats Telegram delivers (Ogg Opus, MP3, M4A, WAV, etc.).

## Session Tree Navigation

Every prompt and response in Pi is stored as a tree of entries. TelePi exposes this tree so you can review history and jump back to any point to create a new branch.

### `/tree`

Shows the session entry tree as a preformatted diagram with inline navigation buttons.

```
/tree        — default view (last 10 entries, branch points highlighted)
/tree all    — full tree with navigation buttons on every entry
/tree user   — user messages only
```

Inline buttons let you switch between filter modes without retyping the command.

### `/branch <id>`

Navigate to any entry by its short 4-character ID (shown in `/tree`). TelePi asks for confirmation and offers two options:

- **Navigate here** — moves the session leaf to the selected entry; your next message creates a new branch from that point
- **Navigate + Summarize** — same, but first generates a concise summary of the branch you are leaving

### `/label [args]`

Attach human-readable labels to entries so you can find them easily in `/tree`.

```
/label fix-auth          — label the current leaf "fix-auth"
/label <id> fix-auth     — label a specific entry
/label clear <id>        — remove a label
/label                   — list all labels in the session
```

Labeled entries are highlighted in `/tree` output and shown in `/branch` confirmations.

## Session Hand-off

TelePi supports seamless bi-directional session hand-off between Pi CLI and Telegram. Both directions preserve the **full conversation context** — the JSONL session file is the single source of truth, and whichever side opens it gets the complete history, including any messages added by the other side.

### CLI → Telegram (`/handoff`)

You're working in Pi CLI on your laptop and want to continue from your phone:

1. **In Pi CLI**, type `/handoff`
2. The extension hands off your current session to TelePi — in direct mode it launches TelePi, and in `launchd` mode it restarts the configured LaunchAgent — then shuts down Pi CLI
3. **Open Telegram** — TelePi is already running with your full conversation context. Just keep typing (or speak).

**Extension installation** — symlink into Pi's global extensions directory:

```bash
cd /path/to/TelePi
ln -s "$(pwd)/extensions/telepi-handoff.ts" ~/.pi/agent/extensions/telepi-handoff.ts
```

Pi auto-discovers it after symlinking (or run `/reload` in Pi).

The extension supports two hand-off modes, controlled via shell environment variables:

- `TELEPI_HANDOFF_MODE=direct` *(default, source checkout only)* — old behavior: kill the current TelePi dev process and start a new one with `npx tsx src/index.ts`
- `TELEPI_HANDOFF_MODE=launchd` — set `PI_SESSION_PATH` in the `launchd` user environment and restart a LaunchAgent
- `TELEPI_LAUNCHD_LABEL` *(optional, default: `com.telepi`)* — LaunchAgent label to restart in `launchd` mode

#### Direct mode

This mode expects a source checkout because it restarts TelePi via `npx tsx src/index.ts`. If you are running from a GitHub Release artifact, use `launchd` mode instead.

Set `TELEPI_DIR` in your shell profile to point to your TelePi installation (`TELEPI_HANDOFF_MODE=direct` is the default and does not need to be set explicitly):

```bash
export TELEPI_DIR="/path/to/TelePi"
```

#### launchd mode (recommended on macOS)

1. If you are running from a source checkout, build TelePi first:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   Release artifacts already include `dist/`
2. Copy `launchd/com.telepi.plist` to `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.telepi.plist`
3. Replace the placeholder paths with your real TelePi path, Node path, and log file locations. Also ensure a `.env` file with `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USER_IDS` is present in the `WorkingDirectory` (TelePi loads it from `process.cwd()` at startup — see `.env.example`)
4. Load it:
   ```bash
   launchctl bootstrap gui/$UID ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.telepi.plist
   ```
   If you later change the plist or `.env`, restart it with:
   ```bash
   launchctl kickstart -k gui/$UID/com.telepi
   ```
5. Export the hand-off settings in your shell profile:
   ```bash
   export TELEPI_HANDOFF_MODE=launchd
   export TELEPI_LAUNCHD_LABEL=com.telepi
   ```

In `launchd` mode, `/handoff` only does two things: set `PI_SESSION_PATH` in `launchd`, then restart the configured LaunchAgent. That keeps TelePi to a single bot process and avoids Telegram token conflicts.

> **Note:** `launchctl setenv` does not persist across reboots. After a machine restart, `PI_SESSION_PATH` will be cleared and TelePi will start a fresh in-memory session until the next `/handoff`.

> **Note:** Because `KeepAlive` is set in the plist, launchd will automatically restart TelePi if it exits. To fully stop TelePi, unload the agent: `launchctl bootout gui/$UID/com.telepi`.

### Telegram → CLI (`/handback`)

You're on your phone and want to get back to your terminal:

1. **In Telegram**, type `/handback`
2. TelePi disposes the session and sends you the exact command to resume, e.g.:
   ```
   cd '/Users/you/myproject' && pi --session '/Users/you/.pi/agent/sessions/.../session.jsonl'
   ```
3. On macOS, the command is **copied to your clipboard** automatically
4. **In your terminal**, paste and run — Pi CLI opens with the full conversation, including everything from Telegram
5. TelePi stays alive — send any message in Telegram to start a fresh session

You can also resume with the shorthand:

```bash
# Continue the most recent session in the project
cd /path/to/project && pi -c
```

### Manual hand-off

Without the extension, you can hand off manually:

1. Note the session file path from Pi CLI (shown on startup)
2. Set `PI_SESSION_PATH` in TelePi's `.env`
3. Start TelePi with either `npm run dev` (source checkout) or `npm start` (release artifact)

### How it works

Both Pi CLI and TelePi use the same `SessionManager` from the Pi SDK to read/write session JSONL files stored under `~/.pi/agent/sessions/`. When either side opens a session file:

1. `SessionManager.open(path)` loads all entries from the JSONL file
2. `buildSessionContext()` walks the entry tree from the current leaf to the root
3. The full message history (including compaction summaries and branch context) is sent to the LLM

This means hand-off is lossless — no context is dropped regardless of how many times you switch between CLI and Telegram.

## Cross-Workspace Sessions

TelePi discovers sessions from **all** project workspaces stored under `~/.pi/agent/sessions/`. This means:

- **`/sessions`** shows sessions from every project (OpenClawd, homepage, TelePi, etc.), grouped by workspace
- **`/new`** shows a workspace picker when multiple workspaces are known, so you can start a new session in any project
- **Switching sessions** automatically updates the workspace — coding tools are re-scoped to the correct project directory

Sessions are stored under `~/.pi/agent/sessions/--<encoded-workspace-path>--/`.

## Docker

For production use with Docker:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The compose file:
- Mounts `~/.pi/agent` read-only (for auth and settings)
- Mounts `~/.pi/agent/sessions` read-write (for session persistence)
- Mounts your workspace directory read-write
- Runs as non-root, drops capabilities, enables `no-new-privileges`

## Security Notes

- Only Telegram user IDs in `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USER_IDS` can interact with the bot
- Pi tools are scoped to the workspace via `createCodingTools(workspace)` and re-scoped on session switch
- The `/handoff` extension only shuts down Pi CLI if TelePi launches or restarts successfully
- URL sanitization blocks `javascript:` and other unsafe protocols in formatted output
- Shell commands in `/handback` use `spawnSync` (no shell interpretation) for clipboard copy
- Voice files are downloaded to a temporary directory and deleted immediately after transcription
